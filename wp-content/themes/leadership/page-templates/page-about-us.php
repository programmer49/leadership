	            <p>Whether the focus is on development as an organisation, team or individual, the core of our work is about raising levels of capability and consciousness.</p>

	            <p>Leaders, teams and organisations need capabilities, which need to be identified and systematically developed.  And leaders need to be operating at a level of consciousness which enables them to make the right choices, whether that is choices about strategy, or behaviour.</p>

			<h2 class="section-title">Our Philosophy</h2>
			<p><span>Our core belief as a team</span> is that we have to role-model what we do with our clients in order to <span>maintain the privileged position that we have with our clients.</span></p>

			<div class="gap gap-20"></div>

			<p>So, <span>all of the core members of our team are on their own leadership development journeys,</span> all do regular leadership 360s and receive coaching.  <span>We work on our team effectiveness on an ongoing basis,</span> and use the same approach to <span>building our organisation effectiveness,</span> and developing and executing strategy, that we use with our clients.</p>

			<div class="gap gap-20"></div>

			<p>By the same measures we use with our clients, <span>we are a high performing organisation and team, and you will experience this when you work with us.</span></p>
